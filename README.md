# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-CNN
Here I have prepared a Breast cancer classification model using CNN, Dataset used in this project is sklearn's default dataset for breast cancer.
To standardise the data StandardScalar preprocessing is used.
CNN is implemented using tensorflow framework. Layers used in the model are Conv1D, MaxPool1D,Flatten,Dense,Dropout,BatchNormalization and Adam optimizer is used in the model.
Testing accuracy of 97.37% is achieved by the model.
